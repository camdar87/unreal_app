## What is my Game

My game is a very simple and basic clone of subway surfer a game where you must endlessly running towards a stream of obstacles with the aim of collecting as many coins as you can while getting as far as you can. While running in the game you have three lanes you can switch to and you can jump this is all the control you have, you cannot change your speed you cannot move in any other direction.
As mentioned, this is a very simple clone of the game only having the game loop in but could be worked on in future.


## What considerations did you make when planning your mobile game?
I was going to be using the unreal engine I had used in the game dev paper last semester (s1-2022) and I enjoyed it a lot. I had used unity before but nothing too complex plus using unreal gave me a chance to learn new technology. As part of the assignment, I had to make a mobile game to start I had to research how viable making a game in unreal was and I discovered you quit simply making a game as unreal supports it natively, but you still need to do a setup for it. 

Now that I knew I could make a game in unreal I had to work out what I was going to make. The first plan was a small open-world game in which the player could run around solving puzzles, I ended up noting doing this the amount of time it would take but I still wanted to make an open-world game my next idea was a plane game like 1945 air force but 3d and the semi-open world I had to ditch this also because of time. I ended up deciding the game would have to be simple and based on a game that exists already and this was temple run/Subway surfer.



## How did you effectively use of your chosen game engine?
Unreal engine is very powerful, and you can build games for almost all platforms Android and IOS included. I was going to use the most recent version of the engine Unreal 5 but my pc at home could barely run it and to my understanding, there is a bug in the engine that can sometimes cause your project to corrupt so I ended up using 4.27.2 this is what I had used to learn Unreal engine. Building a mobile game in unreal is the same as building any other game in unreal you just need to make sure any texture or mesh is compatible with a mobile game. 
To get the game to build an android APK you need to have the correct version of.
-	Android studio 
-	Android SDK
-	Android NDK
-	Accept the licences agreement 
-	Correct version of JAVA 
-	Microsoft SDK, C++ 


Just to name a few.

Even after all of that getting the game to work on mobile can be hard for example you must play around with the project setting so that a mobile can install the game and play it otherwise you might get  `[Solution!] No Google Play Store Key (No OBB found and no store key)`. Version control can be hard also as GitHub struggles with files over 50MB. But when everything is configured the build is a simple as pressing three buttons.

## What are some areas for improvement?
-	The game only has one level as it is a prototype 
-	Get on play store. 
-	Build for IOS 
-	Add in some sort of server a to show global high score
-	Powerups 
-	Extra features 
-	There is an issue with the start and sometimes when you move left or right it will reset the player to the center resulting in a game over.


## If you were to continue with the mobile game, what are the next steps?

-	Add in new levels. 
-	More menus 
-	Make the game more existing so people want to play it longer as it can get boring.
-	Sound/music. Right, there is no sound of music 
-	Better game environment. The skybox can get very boring even with the day-night cycle 
-	Store player high scores and even have a leaderboard
-	Make work on the desktop better possibly even a web app version.
